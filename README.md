4. The APK will download to your phone or computer

> **Tip:** If downloading on a computer, transfer the APK to your Android device via USB, email, or cloud storage.

### Step 2: Enable Installation from Unknown Sources

Android blocks app installations from outside the Play Store by default. You need to enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser or file manager:

**On Android 8.0+ (Oreo and newer):**
1. When you try to install the APK, Android will prompt you to allow installation
2. Tap **Settings** on the prompt
3. Toggle **"Allow from this source"** ON
4. Go back and continue the installation

**Or manually enable it:**
1. Open **Settings** → **Apps** (or **Apps & notifications**)
2. Tap the **⋮** menu → **Special access** → **Install unknown apps**
3. Find your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) or file manager
4. Toggle **"Allow from this source"** ON

**On older Android versions (7.x and below):**
1. Open **Settings** → **Security**
2. Enable **"Unknown sources"**
3. Confirm the warning prompt

### Step 3: Install the APK

1. Open your **Downloads** folder or file manager
2. Tap the `OpenRadiaCode-v{VERSION}.apk` file
3. Tap **Install**
4. Wait for installation to complete
5. Tap **Open** to launch the app

### Step 4: Grant Permissions

When you first run the app, grant these permissions when prompted:
- **Bluetooth** - Required to connect to your RadiaCode device
- **Location** - Required by Android for BLE scanning (the app doesn't track your location)
- **Notifications** - For radiation alerts and background service status

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "App not installed" error | Make sure you don't have a conflicting version. Uninstall any old version first. |
| Can't find the APK | Check your browser's download folder, usually `/Download/` |
| "Installation blocked" | Enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser (Step 2) |
| App crashes on launch | Ensure your Android version is 8.0 or higher |

### Updating the App

To update to a newer version:
1. Download the new APK from the `Installer/` folder
2. Install it over the existing app (your settings will be preserved)
3. If installation fails, uninstall the old version first, then install the new one

## Overview

Key goal: appliance-style operation — once a preferred device is set, a foreground service keeps connecting and polling in the background, with home screen widgets showing the latest readings. The app automatically connects on boot and maintains connection in the background.

## Features

### Dashboard

- **Delta cards** showing change rates with statistical sparklines
- **Spike detection** with configurable markers and percentage annotations
- **Statistical analysis** with z-score highlighting and trend indicators
- **Tap charts to focus** - full-screen chart view with enhanced detail

### Smart Alerts
- Configure up to **10 custom alerts**
- **Threshold-based**: trigger when dose/count goes above or below a value
- **Statistical alerts**: trigger when readings deviate beyond 1σ, 2σ, or 3σ from the mean
- **Duration requirements**: condition must persist for N seconds before triggering
- **Cooldown periods**: prevent alert spam with configurable quiet periods
