{"text":"Hotspot Prediction interpolates radiation levels across your surveyed area to predict where the highest concentrations likely exist. Using inverse distance weighting, I estimate radiation levels at locations you have not directly measured. This reveals the probable radiation landscape between and beyond your data. For any point on the map, I calculate a weighted average of nearby measurements where closer readings have more influence. I identify local maxima, locations where predicted values are higher than surrounding areas. These predicted hotspots are ranked by confidence. I provide bearing and distance to the highest known reading and to predicted hotspots. This helps you navigate toward or away from elevated areas."}
